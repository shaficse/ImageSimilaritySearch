# ImageSimilaritySearch
 This project provides tools for computing and comparing image similarities using deep learning features extracted by a pretrained VGG16 model. It includes functionality to preprocess images, compute image embeddings, store and load embeddings, and visualize similarities between a candidate image and a database of images.
